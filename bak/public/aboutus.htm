                <div class="title">About Us</div>
                <div class="title2">Who We Are:</div>
                <div>Trees That Feed Foundation is a not-for-profit public
					charity under US tax code 501(c)(3). Our organization is concerned with people in
                tropical countries where increases in food costs have the greatest impact.
                Wheat, corn and rice, which together form a large percentage of the
					local diet, are imported.
                The costs of these foods continues to rise, putting increased stress on the world's
                poorest people.  Locally based organizations and governments are constrained by limits
                of their resources, while arable land lies idle in many areas. Traditionally grown field
                crops need more land mass while trees need much less space to grow. </div>   <br />

                <div>Because some of us are originally from Jamaica, we have chosen to start our work there.&nbsp;
                Paul Virtue and Mary McLaughlin grew up on farms in Jamaica and are familiar with
                the fruit trees they will help plant.&nbsp; Now that we&#39;ve
					established a good working model in Jamaica, we&#39;ve
					expanded
					into Haiti, working with local organizations there. We have
					also provided trees to communities in Costa Rica and Ghana. </div> <br />

                <div>We believe tree crops are a large part of the answer to
					world food concerns. Tree crops have similar
                nutritional qualities to grains, yet require less input of labor, agro chemicals,
                fertilizers and space. Trees also restore ecological balance to land damaged
                by slash-and-burn farming methods, commercial logging, or neglect. Growing trees
                also capture and sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, converting it to oxygen,
					and storing the carbon for decades if not centuries. Trees
					also create habitat for small animals and birds. Planting a
					tree is a winning bet.</div>

                <div>The breadfruit tree is our first choice. This South Pacific tree bears a large round
                fruit, larger than a grapefruit, with a green skin. The fruit is cooked and the skin is peeled
                for eating. When cooked, it tastes similar to unleavened bread.  It can serve as a substitute
                for flour, rice or potatoes. We have also provided other food
					trees including ackee, mango, avocado, lychee, pomegranate
					and more.<br /><br /></div>

                <div>The National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii has spent years collecting
                and researching different varieties of breadfruit. Dr. Diane Ragone, Director of
                NTBG's Breadfruit Institute, is conducting extensive research on breadfruit, including
                identification of varieties that provide a year-round supply of fruit.</div>

                        <div>Trees can be grown either by small farmers, on field margins, or in urban spaces.
                        When mature, certain trees can support growth of understory plants, including beans and
                        coffee. <br /><br /></div>
