                <div class="title">The Breadfruit Tree</div>
                <div>The first tree we have selected is the breadfruit. Research shows it is already
                well known throughout many parts of Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Central America. However,
                breadfruit trees are very difficult to propagate. Seedlings are often in short supply because
                the only traditional method of propagating these seedless trees, is by root cuttings. The other
                difficulty with breadfruit  is that the existing cultivars in the  Caribbean (introduced in 1793)
                all bear fruit at the same
                <a href="images/breadfruittree_large.jpg" target="_blank">
                <img src="images/breadfruittree_medium.jpg" alt="A Breadfruit Tree" border="0"
                    style="float: right; padding: 20px;" width="300px" height="249px"/></a>
                time, July through October. Since the fruit is not easily stored,
                it has limited all year use as a starch substitute in the tropics. Researchers at the Hawaii
                based Breadfruit Institute have identified varieties in the Pacific that bear at different
                times of the year. They have also perfected tissue culture propagation methods. The plan is to
                distribute these year-round cultivars as the canopy species.</div><br />


                <div>Breadfruit bears a fruit somewhat smaller than a soccer ball. One fruit can easily
                provide the carbohydrate portion of a meal for a family of five. A mature tree can produce up
                to a half ton of fruit per year. In controlled orchard settings the trees are heavily pruned for
                easy reaping. A hectare, planted at a density of 125 trees out-produces all tropical starch crops,
                yielding upward of 30,000 kilos of fruit annually. Breadfruit is a true tropical tree that was the
                basis of Polynesian expansion through the Pacific. Although there is some tolerance to salt and
                drought, the best cultivars need temperatures in excess of 16 degrees C and rainfall between
                1200-3000 mm annually. There are few pests and the trees require little resource once established.</div> <br />

                <div>The objective of Trees That Feed Foundation is to supply hardened field-ready tissue
                culture based plants to tropical countries, starting with those countries that are already
                familiar with the tree. If successful, this has the potential to substantially reduce hunger and
                to reduce the dependence on now expensive imported corn, rice and wheat. The trees are useful as a
                carbon sequestration sink, allow understory crops and since this is a crop that does not require
                annual soil plowing.  This will help conserve soil. Fruiting trees are more likely to be valued and
                less likely to be cut down. </div>

                It is ironic that this tree, which was the purpose of Captain Bligh's famous "Mutiny on the Bounty" voyage,
                and has the ability to feed so many people, is in decline throughout its range. In Jamaica, for example,
                there were 2.3 million breadfruit trees in the 1950's. The number declined to 46,000 by 1986, although
                numbers have since increased somewhat under a Government program. Heavy marketing, convenience of use
                and the US crop subsidy programs have caused a steady shift over the past four decades from local foods
                to imported wheat, corn and rice. <br /><br />

                Trees That Feed Foundation is in the process of forming a partnership with the Breadfruit
                Institute in Hawaii.  We will act as a distributor of cultivars that do not now exist outside
                the Pacific region. We will act as a distributor of selected breadfruit cultivars. Since tissue culture
                propagation is somewhat new to breadfruit and these cultivars are unknown,
                our plan is to run trials of about 500 plants in Jamaica to test the viability of the propagation and
                to consumer test the acceptability of the fruit. If the trials prove successful, our goal is to increase
                the distribution up to a rate of 1,000,000 plants over five years in as many as fourteen countries in the
                Caribbean, Central America, Africa and Asia.
