        <div>
          Our Foundation's vision is seeing local communities in developing countries with sustainable food supplies, accessible markets for their excess food production, jobs for their people, and an improved, reforested environment.  We are helping by planting food producing trees, providing education, supplying equipment, fostering small farmers and cooperatives, and enabling commercial ventures.  We see improved diets and independence from imported foods and agro chemicals. </div>

          Mission</div>
        <div>
          Our mission is planting trees to feed people, create jobs and benefit the environment. Many tropical countries experience hunger, yet many species of suitable trees produce edible fruit. It is our mission to supply individuals and groups with quantities of the best varieties of these trees, while being sensitive to the environment. We avoid trees that are invasive or genetically engineered. We focus on those that require minimal use of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals. We are supplying trees for planting in small farms, field margins, agroforests and urban backyards. We will also work with commercial orchards on large scale planting.</div>

          Purpose</div>
        <div>
          Our purpose is to help supply additional food to needy communities using fruit bearing trees. We assist subsistence farmers in transforming their fields into agro-forests where required. We encourage shade tolerant trees growing under canopies of larger trees, all bearing fruit, for example, cocoa or coffee growing in the shade of the breadfruit tree. We provide training in care of the trees and reaping the fruit. We provide equipment to help make post-harvest products.  And we leverage our efforts by collaborating with local partners, including government bodies, NGOs, co-ops, service clubs, churches, schools and community associations.</div>
